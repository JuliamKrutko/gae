Inside relational databases, this typically is represented by a foreign key onto its own table. In Django\u2019s ORM, we use ``models.ForeignKey('self', ...)``, to create this kind of recursive relationship.\r\nThe major problem with this kind of representation is, that it doesn\u2019t scale for deep trees. Whenever we have to traverse the tree from a given starting node, our code has to perform one database query per hierarchy level.\r\nTo circumvent this, some database vendors implemented SQL dialects, to fetch a whole subtree with one query. Long time ago, Oracle for instance implemented 'CONNECT BY', which is proprietary and not part of the SQL standard. Nowadays, newer releases of most major database vendors implemented the 'WITH RECURSIVE' clause, which has been added to the SQL-99 standard. This allows us to build recursive queries.\r\n\r\nFortunately there is a clever recipe to represent hierarchies in relational databases using standard SQL techniques, but without the mentioned scaling problem: Materialized Path Trees, discovered by Vadim Tropashko. Django\u2019s ecosystem offers two libraries, which implement this design pattern: **django-mptt** and **django-treebeard**. I also would like to mention **django-tree**, which only works on Postgres, using their SQL extension mentioned before.\r\nIn this talk I\u2019ll explain the design patterns for Materialized Path Trees. Furthermore I\u2019ll show the pros and cons of both libraries.",

There are various laws that factor into the amount of web accessibility a country must have, and the consequences a business can face because of that. Accessible web development also tends to lead to better UX and a happier user base. And, another plus: It will save devs time and frustration when they\u2019re working with the code, since good HTML is enforced.\r\n\r\nThis talk will start with a broad introduction to accessibility, how to break different concerns down into categories for consideration, and touch on some laws around web accessibility. The second part will go through examples of good and bad accessibility and what to look out for, as well as ways to improve accessibility (including \"easy wins\" that they could implement quickly to drastically improve their sites).

How do we bridge between Django's synchronous world and the async world when we do reach that boundary?\r\n\r\nWe also take a look at how it's changed both Channels consumers, opening up the possibility of mixing async calls in with your synchronous code, and how it's changed what the ASGI spec looks like and what that might mean for adoption.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, we'll look what's next for Django and Channels, and maybe how it will affect the Python web world as a whole.",

                "description": "This is a community talk. My favourite topics from DjangoConEU 2017 were the non-technical talks. The most interesting (on-topic) conversations I had were about the non-programming aspects of working in software. I wanted to give a talk on that line. \r\n\r\n_Prima facie_ I'm not the best place person to talk about diversity (white, male, etc), but, having been freelance since 2006, with four young children, and now slightly greying hair, I am in a position to talk about how to build a career in software development for the long-haul. Hiring in tech is massively ageist. I want to discuss strategies to handle that. \r\n\r\nMy target audience is individual programmers (whether freelance or employed) as well as software managers, looking to build **and retain** a team. (The message for managers is simply that they need to facilitate their employees' careers. This seems obvious but it **is** worth bringing out.) \r\n\r\nThe core point of my talk is around the idea that a career is very much a marathon rather than a sprint, and that it needs to be approached in that spirit. (Again, this may seem obvious but it **is** worth bringing out.)\r\n\r\nThere are two aspects of this. The one is **pace**. That to work on software day-in, day-out for 10, 20, 30, 40 years (or more) we need to pace ourselves, to manage our reserves, and to have fun. \r\n\r\nThe other is that there is noting to be scared of. That expertise which now may seem intimidating is, yes, available to us too. That with 5, 10, 15 years of continued effort we too (yes, us) can be as experienced as whomever, in the speciality we choose. \r\n\r\nI bring this out with three points. That we need to: \r\n\r\n* **Be disciplined**: The key point is to keep going. We each need to find patterns that work for us and develop them into habits that we build into a routine. The great thing is it doesn't have to be 100 hour weeks. As long as we keep doing it, whatever we do builds up over time. Despite the impression to the contrary, time is on our side. Which leads to...\r\n\r\n* **Be prolific**: Do lots, and put it out there. This one seems scary. \"I'll never do as much as ...\" \u2014\u00a0but it's an illusion. Do one thing. Put that out there. Do something else. Repeat. Again, the work builds up over time, and (seemingly) all of a sudden, you're in a position of being the expert. Finally...\r\n\r\n* **Be social**: And I don't necessarily mean Facebook (unless Facebook is your thing). In whatever environment or medium suits you get out there meet people. (Stretch your comfort zones a bit here.) Share what you've done. Relish in what others have done. Be part of the community. Help build the community. \r\n\r\nAll three of these are essential. As you get older \u2014 all the more as you get older \u2014 they allow you to build a sustainable career writing software.\r\n\r\nThis tale is brought out with stories on finding work, and on choosing clients, and employers, financial planning and job security, on family and free-time, and on the importance self-care. It's part inspiration, part battle-plan.",

The new rules are however simple enough to understand, and as professionals, getting on top of things like this is what we're being paid for.\r\n\r\nThe regulation is called \"Regulation (EU) 2016/679\" and is commonly known as the \"General Data Protection Regulation\" or \"GDPR\". It has been around for a couple of years and comes into effect now. The previous regime (95/46/EC) was only an EU Directive, so the exact rules were implemented in the native laws of each EU Member State. The new regulation applies everywhere automatically, so it is a single set of rules for all of Europe, which is a good thing. Not everyone will be responsible for managing compliance, but I think every professional software developer should get to know this regulation.\r\n\r\nIn the first half, I'll provide an overview of the parts of the regulation that are relevant for developers. In the second half, I'll look at the ways of complying using Django: what Django already does for you, how to make Django do more, and also (quickly) what sort of data protecting batteries might be useful Django to include going forward.\r\n\r\nI'll be around for the sprints if anyone is interested in working on this at a framework level.",

Most resources fall into one of two camps: they teach you the bare bones of Docker but still leave you with too many questions to comfortably try it on your own, or they throw you into the deep end by assuming you're more familiar with Docker than you are.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will find that middle ground: a talk that doesn't assume you're familiar with Docker and so keeps everything simple, but leaves you with enough information that you can get started as soon as you leave the room. Together, we will step through the parts of a Dockerfile and learn what they do. Then, I'll introduce you to Docker Compose and explain why using it to run multiple containers is helpful. Finally, you will learn to run commands and execute scripts from the command line using Docker, how to enter a container and why you might need to, and what to do before you go home for the day.",
                "description": "This talk is for Djangonauts who are curious about Docker, need to learn to use it for work or personal projects, or who seek a better understanding of containers in general. Audience members might be beginners to Python/Django or not, but they are definitely beginners to containerizing all the things. \r\n\r\nThe audience should be familiar with basic Python concepts such as variables and running things from the command line. Some basic familiarity with Django would be helpful, as the sample project I will demo is a Django app, but beginner Djangonauts will be able to follow along. \r\n\r\n1. Introduction - Who am I? (1 minute) \r\n2. What is Docker? Why use it? (3 min) \r\n  - Eliminates \"it works on my machine\" problems \r\n  - Never install anything globally ever again \r\n  - Great for working with teams \r\n3. Docker definitions (4 min) \r\n  - Image \r\n  - Container \r\n  - Dockerfile \r\n  - Where do virtual environments fit in? \r\n4. Dockerfile (5 min) \r\n  - Go through parts: Python image, setting environment variables, dealing with requirements.txt, set working directory of /code/, expose port \r\n5. Docker Compose \r\n  - What is Docker Compose? (3 min) \r\n    - Allows you to run more than one container in a Docker application\r\n    - Useful for running multiple services like your web server, database, Redis, etc. in separate containers as part of one Docker application \r\n   - docker-compose.yml (6 min) \r\n    - Version \r\n    - Define services (db and web for this presentation)\r\n    - Explain volumes \r\n    - Run commands from services, like runserver \r\n    - Define dependencies \r\n6. Docker on the Command Line (8 min) \r\n  - docker-compose up\r\n  - manage.py commands (docker-compose run web ./manage.py [command]) \r\n  - running tests (docker-compose run web py.test [or ./runtests.py]) \r\n  - opening a shell (docker-compose run web bash) \r\n  - viewing containers (docker ps) and entering a container (see where the /code/ dir is that we created in the Dockerfile) \r\n  - docker-compose down \r\n7.

Now wait until the profanity stops.\r\n\r\nHandling dates and time is an incredibly common requirement in computer applications. That's hardly surprising - we all use computers to record when we did old things, track how long things take, and to plan when we're going to do things. So why is dealing with time so difficult?\r\n\r\nWell, it's because time has a very sordid history. What we even think of as time has changed. In this talk, you'll travel through time, and see the impact that two thousand years of history have had on our modern life. You'll be shown how all this wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey history stuff affects the data modelling and APIs we use on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nThis is going to take... some time.",
